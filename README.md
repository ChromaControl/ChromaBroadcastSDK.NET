# Razer Chroma Broadcast SDK
This repository contains the source code for the .NET wrapper of the Razer Chroma Broadcast SDK.

## Getting Started
This repository contains both the wrapper source code as well as a demo app to be able to test the library and as an example on how to use the library. This app however will not function without a proper Razer app id. You may reach out to Razer [here](https://developer.razer.com/contact/) to get an app id.

This library has a dependency on Razer Synapse 3 and its Chroma Connect module being installed, this library and sample app will not work without them.

Logs can be found in the `Razer\ChromaBroadcast\logs` folder within your ProgramFiles directory.
